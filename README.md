# SourceFileAnalyzer
Nowadays more and more people are seeking to apply, develop and add to their skills the computer science field. 
Consequently, a need has risen to write clean, efficient, well documented and readable code. The purpose of this research is
to measure programming style from source code. By doing so, it not only may be an effective tool for companies to filter people
by their competence, but also could be a great tool for students hoping to improve their abilities. This research is intended 
to focus on the semantical aspects of the source code, using abstract syntax trees and deep learning in order to achieve 
the desired results mentioned above.
